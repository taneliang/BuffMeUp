    <h3>What is BuffMeUp? </h3>
      <p>BuffMeUp is an initiative to reduce food wastage from buffets
      while filling the stomachs of peckish people in Singapore.<br> It's a win-win situation.</p>

    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
      <p>If someone finds their buffet has way too much leftover food for them
        to possibly consume by themselves, they can make a post on BuffMeUp.<br>

        Their buffet will then be visible on our "Today" page and potential
        buffet helpers will be able to respond to the culinary call to arms.<br>

        Once a buffet has been vanquished, a user will be able to celebrate the
        victory by deleting the post so that the world may know of their great
        accomplishment!<br>
        (So other brave buffet helpers don't end up visiting an empty buffet)<br>
